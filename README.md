# Multi Converter
### Description:
Excited to develop a desktop application, I teamed up with a friend to create "The Multi-Converter," a tool for converting various rates and measurements such as time, currency, and the metric system. Tackling the time conversion was a great learning experience, as the logic was straightforward due to constant conversion rates. Despite challenges with fluctuating rates for other conversions, we made significant progress.

### How To Install:
* Using Visual studio Community (Not VSCode ) clone the repository using the github link
* After cloning the repository, wait for the project to build
* Once the project is done building and compiling, simply click the **Start** button at the top of the nav bar

### Usage
* This open-source application, "The Multi-Converter," can be used in various scenarios such as simplifying everyday calculations for students and professionals who need quick and accurate conversions of time, currency, and metric measurements. It serves as a valuable tool for travelers dealing with different time zones and currencies. Additionally, developers can use it as a foundational project to expand and customize further, fostering innovation and collaboration within the open-source community.
